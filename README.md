app.js - mobile webapps made easy
=================================

App.js is a lightweight JavaScript UI library for creating mobile webapps that behave like native apps, sacrificing neither performance nor polish.

* cross-platform (Android 2.2+, iOS 4.3+)
* themable platform-specific UI designs
* configurable native-like transitions
* automatically managed navigation stack
* built-in widgets for general use-cases

The goal of App.js is to provide a robust starting point for mobile webapps, handling general scenarios, and maintaining compatiblity with other common JavaScript libraries.

* Whats added in App-J v. App 
	+ Cooler name
	+ A whole extra character in aforementioned name
	+ Added support for browser back handling, appjs is great within Kik,
	  but as soon as someone hits the back button on android or bb10 which
	  is handled in app-j.js! :p
